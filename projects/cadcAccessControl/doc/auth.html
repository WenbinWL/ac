<h2>User Class Features </h2>
In the system, a user is uniquely identified by one Principal (in CADC's case that is of type NumericPrincipal) but can have a number of other  identities for different contexts:
<ul>
    <li>HttpPrincipal: Web user identity associated with Simple HHTP User Password access.</li>
    <li>X500Principal: X509 certificate identity. </li>
    <li>NumericPrincipal: An numeric identity associated with a user. Typically, used internally within a system.</li>
    <li>OpenIdPrincipal: An OpenID identity. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Group Class Features</h2>
Groups represet associations of users. Members of groups can be groups of users or simple users. groupWrite and groupRead represent the groups that have read and read-and-write permissions to the current group.
